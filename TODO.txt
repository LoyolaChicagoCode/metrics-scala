- look into parallelization
- timing/performance for larger repos e.g. Linux
- question about multiple branches (graph) - initially make the desired branch a parameter (default: main) - can do for all
- can I run a tool on one or more files at a specific commit in history, e.g. how have dependencies in build.sbt or requirements.txt have evolved
